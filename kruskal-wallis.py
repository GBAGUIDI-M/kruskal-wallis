    The Kruskal-Wallis H-test tests the null hypothesis that the population
    median of all of the groups are equal.  It is a non-parametric version of
    ANOVA.  The test works on 2 or more independent samples, which may have
    different sizes.  Note that rejecting the null hypothesis does not
    indicate which of the groups differs.  Post hoc comparisons between
    groups are required to determine which groups are different. This function,
    performs the Kruskal-Wallis test on a DataFrame to compare medians
     across groups.
 Arguments:
       data: A pandas DataFrame containing the data for the test.
       This data will have 2 or more columns.
